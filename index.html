            <h2>An Excerpt from Dr. Jekyll and  Mr. Hyde</h2>

            <div>

                <p id="litp1">There was no mirror, at that date, in my room; that which stands beside me as I write, 
                was brought there later on and for the very purpose of these transformations. The night 
                however, was far gone into the morning--the morning, black as it was, was nearly ripe for
                the conception of the day--the inmates of my house were locked in the most rigorous hours
                of slumber; and I determined, flushed as I was with hope and triumph, to venture in my
                new shape as far as to my bedroom. I crossed the yard, wherein the constellations looked
                down upon me, I could have thought, with wonder, the first creature of that sort that
                heir unsleeping vigilance had yet disclosed to them; I stole through the corridors,
                a stranger in my own house; and coming to my room, I saw for the first time the 
                appearance of Edward Hyde.</p>

                <p>I must here speak by theory alone, saying not that which I know, but that which 
                I suppose to be most probable. The evil side of my nature, to which I had now 
                transferred the stamping efficacy, was less robust and less developed than the good
                which I had just deposed. Again, in the course of my life, which had been, after all, 
                nine tenths a life of effort, virtue and control, it had been much less exercised and 
                much less exhausted. And hence, as I think, it came about that Edward Hyde was so much 
                smaller, slighter and younger than Henry Jekyll. Even as good shone upon the countenance
                of the one, evil was written broadly and plainly on the face of the other. Evil besides
                (which I must still believe to be the lethal side of man) had left on that body an 
                imprint of deformity and decay. And yet when I looked upon that ugly idol in the glass,
                I was conscious of no repugnance, rather of a leap of welcome. This, too, was myself.
                It seemed natural and human. In my eyes it bore a livelier image of the spirit, it
                seemed more express and single, than the imperfect and divided countenance I had 
                been hitherto accustomed to call mine. And in so far I was doubtless right. I have 
                observed that when I wore the semblance of Edward Hyde, none could come near to me 
                at first without a visible misgiving of the flesh. This, as I take it, was because 
                all human beings, as we meet them, are commingled out of good and evil: and Edward Hyde,
                alone in the ranks of mankind, was pure evil.</p>

                <p>I lingered but a moment at the mirror: the second and conclusive experiment had
                yet to be attempted; it yet remained to be seen if I had lost my identity beyond 
                redemption and must flee before daylight from a house that was no longer mine; and 
                hurrying back to my cabinet, I once more prepared and drank the cup, once more suffered 
                the pangs of dissolution, and came to myself once more with the character, the stature 
                and the face of Henry Jekyll.</p>
